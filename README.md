The Odin Project
Web 101: First JS Project


This project was created as part of The Odin Project web development course.

The purpose of this little web game is to practice what I have learned about JavaScript, utilizing a basic looping structure, seeing the way functions and their vairables interact, creating (hopefully) effective and concise conditionals, and handling user input.

v 0.9

The game works, but it is not pretty. There is no real front end to speak of, as that is not the goal of this exercise.

Encounters security error in FireFox in Ubuntu Linux when repeatedly providing improper inputs.
